description: Audit the active repo, MCP servers, plugins, connectors, env surfaces, and harness setup, then recommend the highest-value ECC-native skills, hooks, agents, and operator workflows. Use when the user wants help setting up Claude Code or understanding what capabilities are actually available in their environment.

# Workspace Surface Audit

Read-only audit skill for answering the question "what can this workspace and machine actually do right now, and what should we add or enable next?"

This is the ECC-native answer to setup-audit plugins. It does not modify files unless the user explicitly asks for follow-up implementation.

## When to Use

- User says "set up Claude Code", "recommend automations", "what plugins or MCPs should I use?", or "what am I missing?"
- Auditing a machine or repo before installing more skills, hooks, or connectors
- Comparing official marketplace plugins against ECC-native coverage
- Reviewing `.env`, `.mcp.json`, plugin settings, or connected-app surfaces to find missing workflow layers
- Deciding whether a capability should be a skill, hook, agent, MCP, or external connector

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Never print secret values. Surface only provider names, capability names, file paths, and whether a key or config exists.
- Prefer ECC-native workflows over generic "install another plugin" advice when ECC can reasonably own the surface.
- Treat external plugins as benchmarks and inspiration, not authoritative product boundaries.
- Separate three things clearly:
  - already available now
  - available but not wrapped well in ECC
  - not available and would require a new integration

## Audit Inputs

Inspect only the files and settings needed to answer the question well:

1. Repo surface
   - `package.json`, lockfiles, language markers, framework config, `README.md`
   - `.mcp.json`, `.lsp.json`, `.claude/settings*.json`, `.codex/*`
   - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, install manifests, hook configs
2. Environment surface
   - `.env*` files in the active repo and obvious adjacent ECC workspaces
   - Surface only key names such as `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `FAL_KEY`
3. Connected tool surface
   - Installed plugins, enabled connectors, MCP servers, LSPs, and app integrations
4. ECC surface
   - Existing skills, commands, hooks, agents, and install modules that already cover the need

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Inventory What Exists

Produce a compact inventory:

- active harness targets
- installed plugins and connected apps
- configured MCP servers
- configured LSP servers
- env-backed services implied by key names
- existing ECC skills already relevant to the workspace

If a surface exists only as a primitive, call that out. Example:

- "Stripe is available via connected app, but ECC lacks a billing-operator skill"
- "Google Drive is connected, but there is no ECC-native Google Workspace operator workflow"
