# Content Engine

Build platform-native content without flattening the author's real voice into platform slop.

## When to Activate

- writing X posts or threads
- drafting LinkedIn posts or launch updates
- scripting short-form video or YouTube explainers
- repurposing articles, podcasts, demos, docs, or internal notes into public content
- building a launch sequence or ongoing content system around a product, insight, or narrative

## Non-Negotiables

1. Start from source material, not generic post formulas.
2. Adapt the format for the platform, not the persona.
3. One post should carry one actual claim.
4. Specificity beats adjectives.
5. No engagement bait unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Source-First Workflow

Before drafting, identify the source set:
- published articles
- notes or internal memos
- product demos
- docs or changelogs
- transcripts
- screenshots
- prior posts from the same author

If the user wants a specific voice, build a voice profile from real examples before writing.
Use `brand-voice` as the canonical workflow when voice consistency matters across more than one output.

## Voice Handling

`brand-voice` is the canonical voice layer.

Run it first when:

- there are multiple downstream outputs
- the user explicitly cares about writing style
- the content is launch, outreach, or reputation-sensitive

Reuse the resulting `VOICE PROFILE` here instead of rebuilding a second voice model.
If the user wants Affaan / ECC voice specifically, still treat `brand-voice` as the source of truth and feed it the best live or source-derived material available.

## Hard Bans

Delete and rewrite any of these:
- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape"
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"
- "here's why this matters" unless it is followed immediately by something concrete
- ending with a LinkedIn-style question just to farm replies
- forced casualness on LinkedIn
- fake engagement padding that was not present in the source material
