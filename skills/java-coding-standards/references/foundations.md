# Foundations

## How It Works

### Framework Detection

Before applying standards, determine the framework from the build file:

- Build file contains `quarkus` → apply **[QUARKUS]** conventions
- Build file contains `spring-boot` → apply **[SPRING]** conventions
- Neither detected → apply shared conventions only

## Core Principles

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Immutable by default; minimize shared mutable state
- Fail fast with meaningful exceptions
- Consistent naming and package structure
- **[QUARKUS]**: Favor build-time over runtime processing; avoid runtime reflection where possible

## Examples

The sections below show concrete Spring Boot, Quarkus, and shared Java examples
for naming, immutability, dependency injection, reactive code, exceptions,
project layout, logging, configuration, and tests.
