# Automation Audit Ops

Use this when the user asks what automations are live, which jobs are broken, where overlap exists, or what tooling and connectors are actually doing useful work right now.

This is an audit-first operator skill. The job is to produce an evidence-backed inventory and a keep / merge / cut / fix-next recommendation set before rewriting anything.

## Skill Stack

Pull these ECC-native skills into the workflow when relevant:

- `workspace-surface-audit` for connector, MCP, hook, and app inventory
- `knowledge-ops` when the audit needs to reconcile live repo truth with durable context
- `github-ops` when the answer depends on CI, scheduled workflows, issues, or PR automation
- `ecc-tools-cost-audit` when the real problem is webhook fanout, queued jobs, or billing burn in the sibling app repo
- `research-ops` when local inventory must be compared against current platform support or public docs
- `verification-loop` for proving post-fix state instead of relying on assumed recovery

## When to Use

- user asks "what automations do I have", "what is live", "what is broken", or "what overlaps"
- the task spans cron jobs, GitHub Actions, local hooks, MCP servers, connectors, wrappers, or app integrations
- the user wants to know what was ported from another agent system and what still needs to be rebuilt inside ECC
- the workspace has accumulated multiple ways to do the same thing and the user wants one canonical lane

## Guardrails

- start read-only unless the user explicitly asked for fixes
- separate:
  - configured
  - authenticated
  - recently verified
  - stale or broken
  - missing entirely
- do not claim a tool is live just because a skill or config references it
- do not merge or delete overlapping surfaces until the evidence table exists

## Workflow

### 1. Inventory the real surface

Read the current live surface before theorizing:

- repo hooks and local hook scripts
- GitHub Actions and scheduled workflows
- MCP configs and enabled servers
- connector- or app-backed integrations
- wrapper scripts and repo-specific automation entrypoints

Group them by surface:

- local runtime
- repo CI / automation
- connected external systems
- messaging / notifications
- billing / customer operations
- research / monitoring

### 2. Classify each item by live state
