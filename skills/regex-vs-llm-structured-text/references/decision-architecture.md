# Decision Framework and Architecture

## Decision Tree

```
Is the text format consistent and repeating?
├── Yes (>90% follows a pattern) → Start with Regex
│   ├── Regex handles 95%+ → Done, no LLM needed
│   └── Regex handles <95% → Add LLM for edge cases only
└── No (free-form, highly variable) → Use LLM directly
```

Key insight: regex handles 95-98% of cases cheaply and deterministically.
Reserve expensive LLM calls for the remaining edge cases.

## Architecture Pattern

```
Source Text
    │
    ▼
[Regex Parser] ─── Extracts structure (95-98% accuracy)
    │
    ▼
[Text Cleaner] ─── Removes noise (markers, page numbers, artifacts)
    │
    ▼
[Confidence Scorer] ─── Flags low-confidence extractions
    │
    ├── High confidence (≥0.95) → Direct output
    │
    └── Low confidence (<0.95) → [LLM Validator] → Output
```

## When to Use (Full List)

- Quiz/exam question parsing
- Form data extraction
- Invoice/receipt processing
- Document structure parsing (headers, sections, tables)
- Any structured text with repeating patterns where cost matters
