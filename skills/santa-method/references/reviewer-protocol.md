# Santa Method — Independent Dual Review + Rubric Design

## Phase 2: Check It Twice (Independent Dual Review)

Spawn two review agents in parallel. Critical invariants:

1. **Context isolation** — neither reviewer sees the other's assessment
2. **Identical rubric** — both receive the same evaluation criteria
3. **Same inputs** — both receive the original spec AND the generated output
4. **Structured output** — each returns a typed verdict, not prose

```python
REVIEWER_PROMPT = """
You are an independent quality reviewer. You have NOT seen any other review of this output.

## Task Specification
{task_spec}

## Output Under Review
{output}

## Evaluation Rubric
{rubric}

## Instructions
Evaluate the output against EACH rubric criterion. For each:
- PASS: criterion fully met, no issues
- FAIL: specific issue found (cite the exact problem)

Return your assessment as structured JSON:
{
  "verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
  "checks": [
    {"criterion": "...", "result": "PASS|FAIL", "detail": "..."}
  ],
  "critical_issues": ["..."],   // blockers that must be fixed
  "suggestions": ["..."]         // non-blocking improvements
}

Be rigorous. Your job is to find problems, not to approve.
"""
```

```python
# Spawn reviewers in parallel (Claude Code subagents)
review_b = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(...), description="Santa Reviewer B")
review_c = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(...), description="Santa Reviewer C")

# Both run concurrently — neither sees the other
```

## Rubric Design

The rubric is the most important input. Vague rubrics produce vague reviews. Every criterion must have an objective pass/fail condition.

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Failure Signal |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Factual accuracy | All claims verifiable against source material or common knowledge | Invented statistics, wrong version numbers, nonexistent APIs |
| Hallucination-free | No fabricated entities, quotes, URLs, or references | Links to pages that don't exist, attributed quotes with no source |
| Completeness | Every requirement in the spec is addressed | Missing sections, skipped edge cases, incomplete coverage |
| Compliance | Passes all project-specific constraints | Banned terms used, tone violations, regulatory non-compliance |
| Internal consistency | No contradictions within the output | Section A says X, section B says not-X |
| Technical correctness | Code compiles/runs, algorithms are sound | Syntax errors, logic bugs, wrong complexity claims |

### Domain-Specific Rubric Extensions

**Content/Marketing:**
- Brand voice adherence
- SEO requirements met (keyword density, meta tags, structure)
- No competitor trademark misuse
- CTA present and correctly linked

**Code:**
- Type safety (no `any` leaks, proper null handling)
- Error handling coverage
- Security (no secrets in code, input validation, injection prevention)
- Test coverage for new paths

**Compliance-Sensitive (regulated, legal, financial):**
- No outcome guarantees or unsubstantiated claims
- Required disclaimers present
- Approved terminology only
- Jurisdiction-appropriate language
