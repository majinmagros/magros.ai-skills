# Brand Voice

Build a durable voice profile from real source material, then use that profile everywhere instead of re-deriving style from scratch or defaulting to generic AI copy.

## When to Activate

- the user wants content or outreach in a specific voice
- writing for X, LinkedIn, email, launch posts, threads, or product updates
- adapting a known author's tone across channels
- the existing content lane needs a reusable style system instead of one-off mimicry

## Source Priority

Use the strongest real source set available, in this order:

1. recent original X posts and threads
2. articles, essays, memos, launch notes, or newsletters
3. real outbound emails or DMs that worked
4. product docs, changelogs, README framing, and site copy

Do not use generic platform exemplars as source material.

## Collection Workflow

1. Gather 5 to 20 representative samples when available.
2. Prefer recent material over old material unless the user says the older writing is more canonical.
3. Separate "public launch voice" from "private working voice" if the source set clearly splits.
4. If live X access is available, use `x-api` to pull recent original posts before drafting.
5. If site copy matters, include the current ECC landing page and repo/plugin framing.

## What to Extract

- rhythm and sentence length
- compression vs explanation
- capitalization norms
- parenthetical use
- question frequency and purpose
- how sharply claims are made
- how often numbers, mechanisms, or receipts show up
- how transitions work
- what the author never does

## Output Contract

- Extração do **Body of Work**: além de voz de posts, mapear o histórico de criação da marca e marcos visuais/narrativos (BodyOfWork.md).
- Visual Identity Tokens: exportar tokens visuais em `tokens.json` para alinhamento em geração de imagens/vídeo.

Produce a reusable `VOICE PROFILE` block that downstream skills can consume directly. Use the schema in [references/voice-profile-schema.md](references/voice-profile-schema.md).

Keep the profile structured and short enough to reuse in session context. The point is not literary criticism. The point is operational reuse.

## Affaan / ECC Defaults

If the user wants Affaan / ECC voice and live sources are thin, start here unless newer source material overrides it:

- direct, compressed, concrete
- specifics, mechanisms, receipts, and numbers beat adjectives
