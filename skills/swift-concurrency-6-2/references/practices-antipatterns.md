# Practices, Anti-Patterns, When to Use

## Best Practices

- **Start on MainActor** — write single-threaded code first, optimize later
- **Use `@concurrent` only for CPU-intensive work** — image processing, compression, complex computation
- **Enable MainActor inference mode** for app targets that are mostly single-threaded
- **Profile before offloading** — use Instruments to find actual bottlenecks
- **Protect globals with MainActor** — global/static mutable state needs actor isolation
- **Use isolated conformances** instead of `nonisolated` workarounds or `@Sendable` wrappers
- **Migrate incrementally** — enable features one at a time in build settings

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Applying `@concurrent` to every async function (most don't need background execution)
- Using `nonisolated` to suppress compiler errors without understanding isolation
- Keeping legacy `DispatchQueue` patterns when actors provide the same safety
- Skipping `model.availability` checks in concurrency-related Foundation Models code
- Fighting the compiler — if it reports a data race, the code has a real concurrency issue
- Assuming all async code runs in the background (Swift 6.2 default: stays on calling actor)

## When to Use

- All new Swift 6.2+ projects (Approachable Concurrency is the recommended default)
- Migrating existing apps from Swift 5.x or 6.0/6.1 concurrency
- Resolving data-race safety compiler errors during Xcode 26 adoption
- Building MainActor-centric app architectures (most UI apps)
- Performance optimization — offloading specific heavy computations to background
