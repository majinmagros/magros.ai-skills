# Cost-Aware LLM Pipeline

Patterns for controlling LLM API costs while maintaining quality. Combines model routing, budget tracking, retry logic, and prompt caching into a composable pipeline.

## When to Activate

- Building applications that call LLM APIs (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Processing batches of items with varying complexity
- Need to stay within a budget for API spend
- Optimizing cost without sacrificing quality on complex tasks

## Core Concepts

### 1. Model Routing by Task Complexity

Automatically select cheaper models for simple tasks, reserving expensive models for complex ones.

```python
MODEL_SONNET = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
MODEL_HAIKU = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"

_SONNET_TEXT_THRESHOLD = 10_000  # chars
_SONNET_ITEM_THRESHOLD = 30     # items

def select_model(
    text_length: int,
    item_count: int,
    force_model: str | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Select model based on task complexity."""
    if force_model is not None:
        return force_model
    if text_length >= _SONNET_TEXT_THRESHOLD or item_count >= _SONNET_ITEM_THRESHOLD:
        return MODEL_SONNET  # Complex task
    return MODEL_HAIKU  # Simple task (3-4x cheaper)
```

### 2. Immutable Cost Tracking

Track cumulative spend with frozen dataclasses. Each API call returns a new tracker — never mutates state.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class CostRecord:
    model: str
    input_tokens: int
    output_tokens: int
    cost_usd: float

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class CostTracker:
    budget_limit: float = 1.00
    records: tuple[CostRecord, ...] = ()

    def add(self, record: CostRecord) -> "CostTracker":
        """Return new tracker with added record (never mutates self)."""
