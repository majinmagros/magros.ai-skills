# Data Scraper Agent

Build a production-ready, AI-powered data collection agent for any public data source.
Runs on a schedule, enriches results with a free LLM, stores to a database, and improves over time.

**Stack: Python · Gemini Flash (free) · GitHub Actions (free) · Notion / Sheets / Supabase**

## When to Activate

- User wants to gather or monitor any public website or API
- User says "build a bot that checks...", "monitor X for me", "collect data from..."
- User wants to track jobs, prices, news, repos, sports scores, events, listings
- User asks how to automate data collection without paying for hosting
- User wants an agent that gets smarter over time based on their decisions

## When NOT to Use

- One-off scraping scripts (plain Python + requests/BeautifulSoup is enough)
- Paid SERP/API pipelines (use `deep-research`, `exa-search`)
- Video/transcript pipelines (use `claude-video`, `pipeline-video-agente`)

## Quality Checklist

Before marking the agent complete:

- [ ] `config.yaml` controls all user-facing settings — no hardcoded values
- [ ] `profile/context.md` holds user-specific context for AI matching
- [ ] Deduplication by URL before every storage push
- [ ] Gemini client has model fallback chain (4 models)
- [ ] Batch size ≤ 5 items per API call
- [ ] `maxOutputTokens` ≥ 2048
- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` provided for onboarding
- [ ] `setup.py` creates DB schema on first run
- [ ] `enrich_existing.py` backfills AI scores on old rows
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow commits `feedback.json` after each run
- [ ] README covers: setup in < 5 minutes, required secrets, customisation
