# Core Workflow: Read, Table, Decide

## 1. Read the Repo

Establish the real stack before classifying anything:

- languages in use
- frameworks in use
- primary package manager
- test stack
- lint/format stack
- deployment/runtime surface
- operator integrations already present

## 2. Build the Evidence Table

For every candidate surface, record:

- component path
- component type
- proposed bucket
- repo evidence
- short justification

Use this format:

```text
skills/frontend-patterns | skill | DAILY | 84 .tsx files, next.config.ts present | core frontend stack
skills/django-patterns   | skill | LIBRARY | no .py files, no pyproject.toml       | not active in this repo
rules/typescript/*       | rules | DAILY | package.json + tsconfig.json            | active TS repo
rules/python/*           | rules | LIBRARY | zero Python source files             | keep accessible only
```

## 3. Decide DAILY vs LIBRARY

Promote to `DAILY` when:

- the repo clearly uses the matching stack
- the component is general enough to help every session
- the repo already depends on the corresponding runtime or workflow

Demote to `LIBRARY` when:

- the component is off-stack
- the repo might need it later, but not every day
- it adds context overhead without immediate relevance
