# Parallel Review Passes

If parallel subagents are available, split the review into these passes:

1. Agents
   - classify `agents/*`
2. Skills
   - classify `skills/*`
3. Commands
   - classify `commands/*`
4. Rules
   - classify `rules/*`
5. Hooks and scripts
   - classify hook surfaces, MCP health checks, helper scripts, and OS compatibility
6. Extras
   - classify contexts, examples, MCP configs, templates, and guidance docs

If subagents are not available, run the same passes sequentially.
