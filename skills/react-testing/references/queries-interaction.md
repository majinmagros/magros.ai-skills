# Queries, Interaction and Async

## Library Choice

| Runner | When | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Vitest** | Vite, Remix, modern setups | Faster, native ESM, Jest-compatible API |
| **Jest** | Next.js, CRA, established repos | Default for many React projects |
| **Playwright Component Testing** | Real browser engine needed | Use when JSDOM lacks the required feature |
| **Cypress Component Testing** | Real browser, Cypress already in use | Alternative to Playwright CT |

Pick one. Do not run RTL + Vitest AND Playwright CT in the same repo unless you have a clear lane separation.

## Core Principle

Test what the user sees and does, not implementation details.

A test should:

- Render the component with the same providers it has in production
- Interact with it via accessible queries (role, label) and `userEvent`
- Assert visible output and observable side effects (callback fired, request sent)

A test should NOT:

- Inspect component state, props passed to children, or which hooks were called
- Mock React itself or framework hooks
- Assert on the number of renders or DOM structure beyond what affects users

## Query Priority

React Testing Library exposes queries in three tiers — use top-down:

1. **Accessible to everyone**: `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByPlaceholderText`, `getByText`, `getByDisplayValue`
2. **Semantic**: `getByAltText`, `getByTitle`
3. **Test IDs (escape hatch)**: `getByTestId`

```tsx
// Best
screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save/i });

// OK for inputs
screen.getByLabelText("Email");

// Last resort
screen.getByTestId("save-btn");
```

Variants:

- `getBy*` — throws if no match
- `queryBy*` — returns `null` (use for "assert absence")
- `findBy*` — async, returns a Promise (use for elements that appear after async work)

## User Interaction with `userEvent`

```tsx
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

test("submits the form", async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  const onSubmit = vi.fn();
  render(<UserForm onSubmit={onSubmit} />);

  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText("Email"), "user@example.com");
  await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save/i }));

  expect(onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ email: "user@example.com" });
});
```

- Always `await` userEvent calls
- Call `userEvent.setup()` once per test, reuse the returned `user`
- `userEvent` simulates a real browser sequence; `fireEvent` dispatches a single synthetic event — prefer `userEvent`

## Async Patterns

```tsx
// Element that appears after async work
expect(await screen.findByText("Loaded")).toBeInTheDocument();

// Side effect assertion
await waitFor(() => expect(saveSpy).toHaveBeenCalled());

// Element that should disappear
await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.queryByText("Loading"));
```

Never `setTimeout` + assertion — flaky. Use the matchers above.
