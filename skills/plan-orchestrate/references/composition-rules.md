# Chain composition rules

1. **Primary tag selection**: when a step matches multiple tags, the **first one in table order** (top of the table = highest priority) is the primary; the rest are secondaries. Rules 2 and 3 handle specific multi-tag combinations explicitly; otherwise, append secondary chains in tag table order.
2. `impl` + `security` → `tdd-guide,<lang>-reviewer,security-reviewer`.
3. `impl` + `db` → `tdd-guide,database-reviewer,<lang>-reviewer`.
4. **Deduplicate** the resulting chain (preserve first occurrence). E.g. `review` + `lang=unknown` would yield `code-reviewer,code-reviewer`; deduplication collapses it to `code-reviewer`.
5. `<lang>-reviewer` resolves to `code-reviewer` when `lang=unknown`.
6. `<lang>-build-resolver` resolves to `build-error-resolver` when `lang=unknown`. **Special case**: if Phase 0 set `pytorch=true`, use `pytorch-build-resolver` for `build` chains regardless of `<lang>`. There is no `python-build-resolver`; `--lang=python` without `pytorch=true` resolves to `build-error-resolver`.
7. **Zero-tag steps**: if no trigger word matches, set chain to `code-reviewer` and write `no tag matched; default review-only chain` under "Chain rationale".
8. Chain length ≤ 4 after deduplication. If exceeded, drop weakest tag (`lookup` and `docs` first).
9. Do not pair `planner` and `architect` in an `impl` chain (token waste). Pair them only on `design` steps.
10. Steps tagged `impl`, `refactor`, or `migration` end with a **reviewer-class** agent — any of `<lang>-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, or `database-reviewer`. The most domain-specific reviewer wins the tail position (e.g. rule 2's `impl+security` ends with `security-reviewer`; rule 3's `impl+db` ends with `<lang>-reviewer` because `database-reviewer` already gates the migration earlier in the chain). `test` and `build` steps are gated by their own validators (`e2e-runner` and the build resolver respectively) and do not require an additional reviewer.
