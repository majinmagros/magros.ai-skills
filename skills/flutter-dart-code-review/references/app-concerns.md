# Flutter Review — Navigation, errors, l10n, DI, analysis

## 11. Navigation and Routing

### General principles (apply to any routing solution):
- [ ] One routing approach used consistently — no mixing imperative `Navigator.push` with a declarative router
- [ ] Route arguments are typed — no `Map<String, dynamic>` or `Object?` casting
- [ ] Route paths defined as constants, enums, or generated — no magic strings scattered in code
- [ ] Auth guards/redirects centralized — not duplicated across individual screens
- [ ] Deep links configured for both Android and iOS
- [ ] Deep link URLs validated and sanitized before navigation
- [ ] Navigation state is testable — route changes can be verified in tests
- [ ] Back behavior is correct on all platforms

## 12. Error Handling

### Framework error handling:
- [ ] `FlutterError.onError` overridden to capture framework errors (build, layout, paint)
- [ ] `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` set for async errors not caught by Flutter
- [ ] `ErrorWidget.builder` customized for release mode (user-friendly instead of red screen)
- [ ] Global error capture wrapper around `runApp` (e.g., `runZonedGuarded`, Sentry/Crashlytics wrapper)

### Error reporting:
- [ ] Error reporting service integrated (Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, or equivalent)
- [ ] Non-fatal errors reported with stack traces
- [ ] State management error observer wired to error reporting (e.g., BlocObserver, ProviderObserver, or equivalent for your solution)
- [ ] User-identifiable info (user ID) attached to error reports for debugging

### Graceful degradation:
- [ ] API errors result in user-friendly error UI, not crashes
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for transient network failures
- [ ] Offline state handled gracefully
- [ ] Error states in state management carry error info for display
- [ ] Raw exceptions (network, parsing) are mapped to user-friendly, localized messages before reaching the UI — never show raw exception strings to users

## 13. Internationalization (l10n)

### Setup:
- [ ] Localization solution configured (Flutter's built-in ARB/l10n, easy_localization, or equivalent)
- [ ] Supported locales declared in app configuration

### Content:
- [ ] All user-visible strings use the localization system — no hardcoded strings in widgets
- [ ] Template file includes descriptions/context for translators
- [ ] ICU message syntax used for plurals, genders, selects
- [ ] Placeholders defined with types
- [ ] No missing keys across locales

### Code review:
- [ ] Localization accessor used consistently throughout the project
- [ ] Date, time, number, and currency formatting is locale-aware
- [ ] Text directionality (RTL) supported if targeting Arabic, Hebrew, etc.
- [ ] No string concatenation for localized text — use parameterized messages

## 14. Dependency Injection

### Principles (apply to any DI approach):
- [ ] Classes depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations at layer boundaries
- [ ] Dependencies provided externally via constructor, DI framework, or provider graph — not created internally
- [ ] Registration distinguishes lifetime: singleton vs factory vs lazy singleton
- [ ] Environment-specific bindings (dev/staging/prod) use configuration, not runtime `if` checks
- [ ] No circular dependencies in the DI graph
- [ ] Service locator calls (if used) are not scattered throughout business logic

## 15. Static Analysis

### Configuration:
- [ ] `analysis_options.yaml` present with strict settings enabled
- [ ] Strict analyzer settings: `strict-casts: true`, `strict-inference: true`, `strict-raw-types: true`
- [ ] A comprehensive lint rule set is included (very_good_analysis, flutter_lints, or custom strict rules)
- [ ] All sub-packages in monorepos inherit or share the root analysis options

### Enforcement:
- [ ] No unresolved analyzer warnings in committed code
- [ ] Lint suppressions (`// ignore:`) are justified with comments explaining why
- [ ] `flutter analyze` runs in CI and failures block merges

### Key rules to verify regardless of lint package:
- [ ] `prefer_const_constructors` — performance in widget trees
- [ ] `avoid_print` — use proper logging
- [ ] `unawaited_futures` — prevent fire-and-forget async bugs
- [ ] `prefer_final_locals` — immutability at variable level
- [ ] `always_declare_return_types` — explicit contracts
- [ ] `avoid_catches_without_on_clauses` — specific error handling
- [ ] `always_use_package_imports` — consistent import style
