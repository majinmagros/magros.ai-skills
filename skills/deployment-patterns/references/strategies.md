# Deployment — Strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary)

## Rolling Deployment (Default)

Replace instances gradually — old and new versions run simultaneously during rollout.

```
Instance 1: v1 → v2  (update first)
Instance 2: v1        (still running v1)
Instance 3: v1        (still running v1)

Instance 1: v2
Instance 2: v1 → v2  (update second)
Instance 3: v1

Instance 1: v2
Instance 2: v2
Instance 3: v1 → v2  (update last)
```

**Pros:** Zero downtime, gradual rollout
**Cons:** Two versions run simultaneously — requires backward-compatible changes
**Use when:** Standard deployments, backward-compatible changes

## Blue-Green Deployment

Run two identical environments. Switch traffic atomically.

```
Blue  (v1) ← traffic
Green (v2)   idle, running new version

# After verification:
Blue  (v1)   idle (becomes standby)
Green (v2) ← traffic
```

**Pros:** Instant rollback (switch back to blue), clean cutover
**Cons:** Requires 2x infrastructure during deployment
**Use when:** Critical services, zero-tolerance for issues

## Canary Deployment

Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version first.

```
v1: 95% of traffic
v2:  5% of traffic  (canary)

# If metrics look good:
v1: 50% of traffic
v2: 50% of traffic

# Final:
v2: 100% of traffic
```

**Pros:** Catches issues with real traffic before full rollout
**Cons:** Requires traffic splitting infrastructure, monitoring
**Use when:** High-traffic services, risky changes, feature flags
