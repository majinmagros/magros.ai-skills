# Integration and Best Practices

## Integration with Agents

Use in agent prompts:

```markdown
When retrieving context for this task:
1. Start with broad keyword search
2. Evaluate each file's relevance (0-1 scale)
3. Identify what context is still missing
4. Refine search criteria and repeat (max 3 cycles)
5. Return files with relevance >= 0.7
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, narrow progressively** - Don't over-specify initial queries
2. **Learn codebase terminology** - First cycle often reveals naming conventions
3. **Track what's missing** - Explicit gap identification drives refinement
4. **Stop at "good enough"** - 3 high-relevance files beats 10 mediocre ones
5. **Exclude confidently** - Low-relevance files won't become relevant
