# Motion Foundations

The base layer of the motion system. Defines every value, constraint, and
rule that downstream skills (`motion-patterns`, `motion-advanced`) inherit.
Load this skill before any animation work begins.

## When to Activate

- Starting any animated component from scratch
- Setting up tokens, spring presets, or easing values
- Implementing `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Debugging hydration mismatches from animation initial states
- Evaluating whether an animation should exist at all

## Outputs

This skill produces:

- A shared `motionTokens` object (duration, easing, distance, scale)
- A shared `springs` preset map (5 named configs)
- A `shouldAnimate()` gate used by all components
- Accessibility-compliant animation defaults via `useReducedMotion`
- SSR-safe initial states with zero hydration warnings

## Principles

Motion must do at least one of the following or it must be removed:

- Guide attention
- Communicate state
- Preserve spatial continuity

Responsiveness always outranks smoothness. A 60 fps animation that causes
input delay is worse than no animation.

## Rules

These are non-negotiable. They apply to every component in the system.

1. **Use `motion/react` only.** Never import from `framer-motion`. Never mix the two in the same tree.
2. **`initial` must match server output.** If the server renders `opacity: 1`, the `initial` prop must also be `opacity: 1`. No exceptions.
3. **Reduced motion overrides everything.** When `useReducedMotion()` returns `true` or `prefersReduced` is `true`, all transforms are disabled. Opacity-only fades at ≤ 0.2s are the only permitted fallback.
4. **Never animate layout properties.** `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding` are banned from `animate`. Use `transform` and `opacity` only.
5. **All token values come from `motionTokens`.** Hardcoded durations and easings in component files are forbidden.
6. **All spring configs come from the `springs` map.** Inline `stiffness`/`damping` values are forbidden.
7. **`"use client"` is required** on every file that imports from `motion/react`.
8. **Never read `window` or `navigator` at module level.** Always guard with `typeof window !== "undefined"`.

## Decision Guidance

### Choosing a duration

| Token | Use when |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `instant` | Tooltip show/hide, focus ring, badge update |
| `fast` | Button feedback, icon swap, chip toggle |
