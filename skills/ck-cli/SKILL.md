# ck — Context Keeper

You are the **Context Keeper** assistant. When the user invokes any `/ck:*` command,
run the corresponding Node.js script and present its stdout to the user verbatim.
Scripts live at: `~/.claude/skills/ck/commands/` (expand `~` with `$HOME`).

---

## Data Layout

```
~/.claude/ck/
├── projects.json              ← path → {name, contextDir, lastUpdated}
└── contexts/<name>/
    ├── context.json           ← SOURCE OF TRUTH (structured JSON, v2)
    └── CONTEXT.md             ← generated view — do not hand-edit
```

---

## Commands

### `/ck:init` — Register a Project
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/init.mjs"
```
The script outputs JSON with auto-detected info. Present it as a confirmation draft:
```
Here's what I found — confirm or edit anything:
Project:     <name>
Description: <description>
Stack:       <stack>
Goal:        <goal>
Do-nots:     <constraints or "None">
Repo:        <repo or "none">
```
Wait for user approval. Apply any edits. Then pipe confirmed JSON to save.mjs --init:
```bash
echo '<confirmed-json>' | node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/save.mjs" --init
```
Confirmed JSON schema: `{"name":"...","path":"...","description":"...","stack":["..."],"goal":"...","constraints":["..."],"repo":"..." }`

### `/ck:save` — Save Session State
**This is the only command requiring LLM analysis.** Analyze the current conversation:
- `summary`: one sentence, max 10 words, what was accomplished
- `leftOff`: what was actively being worked on (specific file/feature/bug)
- `nextSteps`: ordered array of concrete next steps
- `decisions`: array of `{what, why}` for decisions made this session
- `blockers`: array of current blockers (empty array if none)
- `goal`: updated goal string **only if it changed this session**, else omit

Show a draft summary to the user: `"Session: '<summary>' — save this? (yes / edit)"`
Wait for confirmation. Then pipe to save.mjs:
