# Severity Model

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `critical` | Agent can confidently produce wrong operational behavior | Fix before next release |
| `high` | Agent frequently degrades correctness or stability | Fix this sprint |
| `medium` | Correctness usually survives but output is fragile or wasteful | Plan for next cycle |
| `low` | Mostly cosmetic or maintainability issues | Backlog |

# Output Format

Present findings to the user in this order:

1. **Severity-ranked findings** (most critical first)
2. **Architecture diagnosis** (which layer corrupted what, and why)
3. **Ordered fix plan** (code-first, not prompt-first)

Do not lead with compliments or summaries. If the system is broken, say so directly.

# Quick Diagnostic Questions

When auditing an agent system, answer these:

| # | Question | If Yes → |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Can the model skip a required tool and still answer? | Tool not code-gated |
| 2 | Does old conversation content appear in new turns? | Memory contamination |
| 3 | Is the same info in system prompt AND memory AND history? | Context duplication |
| 4 | Does the platform run a second LLM pass before delivery? | Hidden repair loop |
| 5 | Does the output differ between internal generation and user delivery? | Rendering corruption |
| 6 | Are "must use tool X" rules only in prompt text? | Tool discipline failure |
| 7 | Can the agent's own monologue become persistent memory? | Memory poisoning |

# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Avoid blaming the model before falsifying wrapper-layer regressions.
- Avoid blaming memory without showing the contamination path.
- Do not let a clean current state erase a dirty historical incident.
- Do not treat markdown prose as a trustworthy internal protocol.
- Do not accept "must use tool" in prompt text when code never enforces it.
- Keep findings direct, evidence-backed, and severity-ranked.

# Report Schema

Audits should produce structured reports following this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "ecc.agent-architecture-audit.report.v1",
  "executive_verdict": {
    "overall_health": "high_risk",
    "primary_failure_mode": "string",
    "most_urgent_fix": "string"
  },
  "scope": {
    "target_name": "string",
    "model_stack": ["string"],
    "layers_to_audit": ["string"]
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "title": "string",
      "mechanism": "string",
      "source_layer": "string",
      "root_cause": "string",
      "evidence_refs": ["file:line"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "recommended_fix": "string"
    }
  ],
  "ordered_fix_plan": [
    { "order": 1, "goal": "string", "why_now": "string", "expected_effect": "string" }
  ]
}
```
