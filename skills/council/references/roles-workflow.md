# Roles and Workflow

Convene four advisors for ambiguous decisions:

- the in-context Claude voice
- a Skeptic subagent
- a Pragmatist subagent
- a Critic subagent

This is for **decision-making under ambiguity**, not code review, implementation planning, or architecture design.

## Roles

| Voice | Lens |
| --- | --- |
| Architect | correctness, maintainability, long-term implications |
| Skeptic | premise challenge, simplification, assumption breaking |
| Pragmatist | shipping speed, user impact, operational reality |
| Critic | edge cases, downside risk, failure modes |

The three external voices should be launched as fresh subagents with **only the question and relevant context**, not the full ongoing conversation. That is the anti-anchoring mechanism.

## Workflow

### 1. Extract the real question

Reduce the decision to one explicit prompt:

- what are we deciding?
- what constraints matter?
- what counts as success?

If the question is vague, ask one clarifying question before convening the council.

### 2. Gather only the necessary context

If the decision is codebase-specific:

- collect the relevant files, snippets, issue text, or metrics
- keep it compact
- include only the context needed to make the decision

If the decision is strategic/general:

- skip repo snippets unless they materially change the answer

### 3. Form the Architect position first

Before reading other voices, write down:

- your initial position
- the three strongest reasons for it
- the main risk in your preferred path

Do this first so the synthesis does not simply mirror the external voices.

### 4. Launch three independent voices in parallel

Each subagent gets:

- the decision question
- compact context if needed
- a strict role
- no unnecessary conversation history

Prompt shape:

```text
You are the [ROLE] on a four-voice decision council.

Question:
[decision question]

Context:
[only the relevant snippets or constraints]

Respond with:
1. Position — 1-2 sentences
2. Reasoning — 3 concise bullets
3. Risk — biggest risk in your recommendation
4. Surprise — one thing the other voices may miss

Be direct. No hedging. Keep it under 300 words.
```

Role emphasis:

- Skeptic: challenge framing, question assumptions, propose the simplest credible alternative
- Pragmatist: optimize for speed, simplicity, and real-world execution
- Critic: surface downside risk, edge cases, and reasons the plan could fail
