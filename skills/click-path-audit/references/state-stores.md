# State Store Side-Effect Map

Build this map BEFORE auditing any touchpoint. The "New Email" bug was invisible without knowing that `selectThread` resets `composeMode`.

## Procedure

```
For each Zustand store / React context in scope:
  For each action/setter:
    - What fields does it set?
    - Does it RESET other fields as a side effect?
    - Document: actionName → {sets: [...], resets: [...]}
```

## Output Format

```
STORE: emailStore
  setComposeMode(bool) → sets: {composeMode}
  selectThread(thread|null) → sets: {selectedThread, selectedThreadId, messages, drafts, selectedDraft, summary} RESETS: {composeMode: false, composeData: null, redraftOpen: false}
  setDraftGenerating(bool) → sets: {draftGenerating}
  ...

DANGEROUS RESETS (actions that clear state they don't own):
  selectThread → resets composeMode (owned by setComposeMode)
  reset → resets everything
```

Flag every action that clears state it does not own — those are the prime suspects for Sequential Undo bugs.
