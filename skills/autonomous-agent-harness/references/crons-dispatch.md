# Autonomous Agent Harness — Scheduled Operations (Crons) + Dispatch

## 2. Scheduled Operations (Crons)

Use Claude Code's scheduled tasks to create recurring agent operations.

**Setting up a cron:**

```
# Via MCP tool
mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task({
  name: "daily-pr-review",
  schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5",  # 9 AM weekdays
  prompt: "Review all open PRs in affaan-m/everything-claude-code. For each: check CI status, review changes, flag issues. Post summary to memory.",
  project_dir: "/path/to/repo"
})

# Via claude -p (programmatic mode)
echo "Review open PRs and summarize" | claude -p --project /path/to/repo
```

**Useful cron patterns:**

| Pattern | Schedule | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Daily standup | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Review PRs, issues, deploy status |
| Weekly review | `0 10 * * 1` | Code quality metrics, test coverage |
| Hourly monitor | `0 * * * *` | Production health, error rate checks |
| Nightly build | `0 2 * * *` | Run full test suite, security scan |
| Pre-meeting | `*/30 * * * *` | Prepare context for upcoming meetings |

## 3. Dispatch / Remote Agents

Trigger Claude Code agents remotely for event-driven workflows.

**Dispatch patterns:**

```bash
# Trigger from CI/CD
curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/dispatch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Build failed on main. Diagnose and fix.", "project": "/repo"}'

# Trigger from webhook
# GitHub webhook → dispatch → Claude agent → fix → PR

# Trigger from another agent
claude -p "Analyze the output of the security scan and create issues for findings"
```
