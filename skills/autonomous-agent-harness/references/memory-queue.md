# Autonomous Agent Harness — Persistent Memory + Task Queue

## 1. Persistent Memory

Use Claude Code's built-in memory system enhanced with MCP memory server for structured data.

**Built-in memory** (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`):
- User preferences, feedback, project context
- Stored as markdown files with frontmatter
- Automatically loaded at session start

**MCP memory server** (structured knowledge graph):
- Entities, relations, observations
- Queryable graph structure
- Cross-session persistence

**Memory patterns:**

```
# Short-term: current session context
Use TodoWrite for in-session task tracking

# Medium-term: project memory files
Write to ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/ for cross-session recall

# Long-term: MCP knowledge graph
Use mcp__memory__create_entities for permanent structured data
Use mcp__memory__create_relations for relationship mapping
Use mcp__memory__add_observations for new facts about known entities
```

## 5. Task Queue

Manage a persistent queue of tasks that survive session boundaries.

**Implementation:**

```
# Task persistence via memory
Write task queue to ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/task-queue.md

# Task format
