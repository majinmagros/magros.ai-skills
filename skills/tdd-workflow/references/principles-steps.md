# Core Principles and TDD Steps

## 1. Tests BEFORE Code
ALWAYS write tests first, then implement code to make tests pass.

## 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
- All edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Boundary conditions verified

## 3. Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Individual functions and utilities
- Component logic
- Pure functions
- Helpers and utilities

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- External API calls

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Critical user flows
- Complete workflows
- Browser automation
- UI interactions

## 4. Git Checkpoints
- If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit after each TDD stage
- Do not squash or rewrite these checkpoint commits until the workflow is complete
- Each checkpoint commit message must describe the stage and the exact evidence captured
- Count only commits created on the current active branch for the current task
- Do not treat commits from other branches, earlier unrelated work, or distant branch history as valid checkpoint evidence
- Before treating a checkpoint as satisfied, verify that the commit is reachable from the current `HEAD` on the active branch and belongs to the current task sequence
- The preferred compact workflow is:
  - one commit for failing test added and RED validated
  - one commit for minimal fix applied and GREEN validated
  - one optional commit for refactor complete
- Separate evidence-only commits are not required if the test commit clearly corresponds to RED and the fix commit clearly corresponds to GREEN
- Squash merges are allowed only after the workflow evidence has been preserved in Step 8. If checkpoint commits will be squashed, copy the RED/GREEN/refactor summary into the PR body, squash commit body, or evidence report so reviewers can still answer what was verified and how.

## TDD Workflow Steps

## Step 0: Detect the Test Runner

Do not assume `npm test`. The commands in the steps and examples below use `<test>`, `<test-watch>`, and `<coverage>` as placeholders for the project's actual runner. Resolve them once before starting:

1. **Run the package-manager detector** (ships with ECC):

   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
   ```

   It resolves the package manager (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun) from, in order: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`, `.claude/package-manager.json`, the `package.json` `packageManager` field, the lockfile, then global config.

2. **Distinguish the package manager from the test runner — they are not the same.** A project can use Bun to install dependencies yet still run Jest or Vitest. Inspect `package.json` `scripts.test` and the test files:
   - `scripts.test` invokes `jest` / `vitest` -> run through the detected PM (`npm test`, `pnpm test`, `yarn test`, or `bun run test`).
   - `scripts.test` is `bun test`, or test files `import { test, expect } from "bun:test"`, or there is no jest/vitest config but Bun is present -> use **Bun's native runner** (`bun test`). See [Bun Native Test Pattern](#bun-native-test-pattern-buntest) below.

Runner command matrix:

| Runner | `<test>` | `<test-watch>` | `<coverage>` | `<lint>` |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| npm | `npm test` | `npm test -- --watch` | `npm run test:coverage` | `npm run lint` |
| pnpm | `pnpm test` | `pnpm test --watch` | `pnpm test:coverage` | `pnpm lint` |
| yarn | `yarn test` | `yarn test --watch` | `yarn test:coverage` | `yarn lint` |
| Bun (script runs jest/vitest) | `bun run test` | `bun run test --watch` | `bun run test:coverage` | `bun run lint` |
| Bun (native `bun:test`) | `bun test` | `bun test --watch` | `bun test --coverage` | `bun run lint` |

> `bun test` (Bun's built-in runner) is **not** the same as `bun run test` (which runs the `package.json` `test` script). Picking the wrong one is a common failure — e.g. invoking Jest through `npx`/`bun run` in an ESM-only project breaks, while `bun test` runs the suite natively. Confirm which the project expects before the RED gate, then substitute `<test>` / `<coverage>` everywhere `npm test` appears below.

## Step 1: Write User Journeys

If a `*.plan.md` file was provided, extract the user journeys and acceptance criteria from that plan first. Only write new journeys for gaps the plan does not cover.

```
As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

Example:
As a user, I want to search for markets semantically,
so that I can find relevant markets even without exact keywords.
```

## Step 2: Generate Test Cases
For each user journey, create comprehensive test cases:

```typescript
describe('Semantic Search', () => {
  it('returns relevant markets for query', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })

  it('handles empty query gracefully', async () => {
    // Test edge case
  })

  it('falls back to substring search when Redis unavailable', async () => {
    // Test fallback behavior
  })

  it('sorts results by similarity score', async () => {
    // Test sorting logic
  })
})
```

## Step 3: Run Tests (They Should Fail)
```bash
<test>
# Tests should fail - we haven't implemented yet
```

This step is mandatory and is the RED gate for all production changes.

Before modifying business logic or other production code, you must verify a valid RED state via one of these paths:
- Runtime RED:
  - The relevant test target compiles successfully
  - The new or changed test is actually executed
  - The result is RED
- Compile-time RED:
  - The new test newly instantiates, references, or exercises the buggy code path
  - The compile failure is itself the intended RED signal
- In either case, the failure is caused by the intended business-logic bug, undefined behavior, or missing implementation
- The failure is not caused only by unrelated syntax errors, broken test setup, missing dependencies, or unrelated regressions

A test that was only written but not compiled and executed does not count as RED.

Do not edit production code until this RED state is confirmed.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after this stage is validated.
Recommended commit message format:
- `test: add reproducer for <feature or bug>`
- This commit may also serve as the RED validation checkpoint if the reproducer was compiled and executed and failed for the intended reason
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before continuing

## Step 4: Implement Code
Write minimal code to make tests pass:

```typescript
// Implementation guided by tests
export async function searchMarkets(query: string) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

If the repository is under Git, stage the minimal fix now but defer the checkpoint commit until GREEN is validated in Step 5.

## Step 5: Run Tests Again
```bash
<test>
# Tests should now pass
```

Rerun the same relevant test target after the fix and confirm the previously failing test is now GREEN.

Only after a valid GREEN result may you proceed to refactor.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after GREEN is validated.
Recommended commit message format:
- `fix: <feature or bug>`
- The fix commit may also serve as the GREEN validation checkpoint if the same relevant test target was rerun and passed
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before continuing

## Step 6: Refactor
Improve code quality while keeping tests green:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Optimize performance
- Enhance readability

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after refactoring is complete and tests remain green.
Recommended commit message format:
- `refactor: clean up after <feature or bug> implementation`
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before considering the TDD cycle complete

## Step 7: Verify Coverage
```bash
<coverage>
# Verify 80%+ coverage achieved
```

## Step 8: Write a TDD Evidence Report

After GREEN and coverage are validated, write a short human-readable evidence report. The report is not a replacement for test code; it is an index that explains what the test code proves and preserves that proof across session restarts or squash merges.

Recommended path:

Store the evidence report in the project's standard documentation directory, for example:

```text
docs/testing/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
.github/tdd/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
.claude/tdd/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
```

If the repository already uses Claude-specific local artifacts, the `.claude/tdd/` location is also acceptable. Include:

1. **Source plan** - link the `*.plan.md` file if one was used, or state that journeys were derived during this TDD run.
2. **User journeys** - list the journeys from the plan or the ones written in Step 1.
3. **Task report** - for each plan task or implemented behavior, record:
   - one-sentence execution summary
   - validation command actually run
   - relevant output excerpt, including RED and GREEN results when applicable
   - what is guaranteed by the passing tests
4. **Test specification** - a table of human-readable guarantees:

```markdown
| # | What is guaranteed | Test file or command | Test type | Result | Evidence |
|---|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Empty search returns an empty result list without throwing | `src/search.test.ts:returns empty list for empty query` | unit | PASS | `npm test -- search.test.ts` |
| 2 | API rejects invalid limit values with HTTP 400 | `src/api/markets/route.test.ts:validates query parameters` | integration | PASS | `npm test -- route.test.ts` |
```

5. **Coverage and known gaps** - include the coverage command/result when available and explain any intentional gaps, skipped tests, or untested follow-ups.
6. **Merge evidence** - if checkpoint commits will be squashed, copy the final RED/GREEN/refactor summary here and into the PR body or squash commit body.

Keep the report factual. Quote actual commands and outcomes; do not invent PASS results for tests that were not run.
