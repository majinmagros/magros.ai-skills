# Scoring, Output Format, Example

## Scoring

Use scores to force prioritization, not to imply mathematical certainty.

| Band | Score | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blocked | 0-49 | Do not ship until the top risks are fixed |
| Risky | 50-69 | Ship only behind a small rollout or internal beta |
| Launchable With Caveats | 70-84 | Ship if owners accept the listed risks |
| Strong | 85-100 | No obvious launch blockers from available evidence |

Cap the score at `69` if any of these are true:

- Authentication or authorization is missing on sensitive data.
- Payment or fulfillment webhooks are not idempotent.
- Required migrations cannot be run safely.
- Secrets are exposed in client bundles, logs, or committed files.
- There is no rollback path for a high-impact release.

Cap the score at `84` if CI is not green or the launch-critical path was not
tested end to end.

## Output Format

Lead with one sentence:

```text
Production audit: 76/100, launchable with caveats, with webhook idempotency and rollback docs as the two risks to fix before public launch.
```

Then list:

- `Blockers`: must-fix items before deploy.
- `High-value fixes`: next fixes if the user wants to improve the score.
- `Evidence checked`: files, commands, CI, deployed URL, or PRs inspected.
- `Evidence missing`: what would change confidence if provided.
- `Next action`: one concrete fix or verification step.

Keep strengths short. The user asked for readiness, so the useful answer is the
remaining risk and the next action.

## Example

User:

```text
is this ready to ship?
```

Response:

```text
Production audit: 68/100, risky, because Stripe webhooks are verified but not idempotent and there is no rollback note for the pending migration.

Blockers:
- Add idempotency for `checkout.session.completed` before fulfilling orders.
- Write and test the rollback path for `20260511_add_billing_state.sql`.

High-value fixes:
- Add a health check that verifies database and payment-provider reachability.
- Add one E2E path for upgrade, webhook fulfillment, and billing-page refresh.

Evidence checked:
- `api/stripe/webhook.ts`
- `db/migrations/20260511_add_billing_state.sql`
- GitHub Actions run for the release branch

Next action: Want me to patch webhook idempotency first?
```
