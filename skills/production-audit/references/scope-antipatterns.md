# Scope, Anti-Patterns, See Also

## When Not to Use

- During active implementation when the right lens is line-level secure coding;
  use `security-review` first.
- For pure libraries, templates, docs-only repos, or scaffolds unless the user
  wants packaging/release readiness rather than application readiness.
- When the user asks for a formal compliance audit. This skill is engineering
  triage, not legal, financial, medical, or regulatory certification.
- When the only available evidence is a product idea with no repo, deployment,
  CI, or runtime surface.

## Anti-Patterns

- Running `npx <package>@latest` or a remote scanner as the default audit path.
- Uploading source, secrets, customer data, or private topology to an external
  audit service without explicit approval.
- Producing a score without naming the evidence checked.
- Treating green CI as production readiness.
- Ending with a generic "let me know what you want to do."
