# Principles, Hooks Discipline, State Location

## Core Principles

### 1. Render is a Pure Function of Props and State

```tsx
// Good: derive during render
function Cart({ items }: { items: CartItem[] }) {
  const total = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price * i.qty, 0);
  return <span>{formatMoney(total)}</span>;
}

// Bad: derived state stored separately
function Cart({ items }: { items: CartItem[] }) {
  const [total, setTotal] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    setTotal(items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price * i.qty, 0));
  }, [items]);
  return <span>{formatMoney(total)}</span>;
}
```

Derived state in `useEffect` adds a render cycle, can desync, and obscures the data flow.

### 2. Side Effects Outside Render

Effects, mutations, network calls, and subscriptions live in event handlers or `useEffect` — never in the render body.

### 3. Composition Over Inheritance

React has no inheritance model for components. Compose with `children`, render props, or component props.

## Hooks Discipline

See [rules/react/hooks.md](../../rules/react/hooks.md) for the full ruleset. Highlights:

- Top-level only, never conditional
- Cleanup every subscription, interval, listener
- Functional updater (`setX(prev => prev + 1)`) when new state depends on old
- Default position: do not memoize — add `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when a profiler or a dependency chain proves it matters
- Extract a custom hook only when the same hook sequence appears in 2+ components

## State Location Decision Tree

```
Used by one component?
  -> useState inside it

Used by parent + a few descendants?
  -> lift to nearest common ancestor

Used across distant branches AND low-frequency reads (theme, auth, locale)?
  -> React Context

High-frequency updates shared across the tree?
  -> external store (Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit)

Derived from a server?
  -> server-state library (TanStack Query, SWR, RSC fetch)
```

Most pages do not need context or a global store. Resist abstraction until duplicated lifting becomes painful.
